# Technology Stack

This project utilizes a combination of web technologies for its frontend and a Python-based backend for data processing.

## Frontend

-   **HTML5:** Standard markup language for creating the web pages (`index.html`, `about.html`, etc.).
-   **CSS3:** Used for styling the user interface.
    -   **Bootstrap:** A popular CSS framework is used for responsive design and pre-built components. The project uses the Minty and Superhero themes.
    -   **Less:** A CSS pre-processor is used for more maintainable and organized stylesheets, with source files in the `/less` directory.
-   **JavaScript:** Powers the interactive elements and client-side logic of the application. Key scripts include `core.js` and page-specific logic like `search.js`.

## Backend

-   **Python:** The primary language for the backend, used for fetching data from the Dota 2 API, processing it, and storing it in a local database. The core logic resides in the `DbMaker/` directory.
-   **SQLite:** The `.db` files in the `db/` and `DbMaker/` directories indicate the use of SQLite for local database storage. The databases are periodically generated by the `DbMaker` application.

## Data Source

-   **OpenDota API:** The backend likely interacts with the OpenDota API (or a similar Dota 2 data provider) to fetch player match data, which is then processed and stored.

## Tools & Deployment

-   **Git:** For version control.
-   **GitHub Pages:** The project structure with `index.html` at the root and a `CNAME` file suggests it is deployed as a static site on GitHub Pages.
-   **Docker:** The presence of a `Dockerfile` in the `DbMaker` directory suggests that the backend data-processing application is containerized for a consistent and isolated execution environment.
